At college (way back when), whenever I was given the choice, I would choose the amber terminal over the green one every time.
It's easy on the eye, and somehow cooler.

Anyway, here's my stab at reproducing the experience (with a broader palette of oranges).
And it's in constant daily use. Hope you like it.
